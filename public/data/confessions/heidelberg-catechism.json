      "question": "What is thy only comfort in life and death?",
      "answer": "That I with body and soul, both in life and death, am not my own, but belong unto my faithful Saviour Jesus Christ; who, with his precious blood, has fully satisfied for all my sins, and delivered me from all the power of the devil; and so preserves me that without the will of my heavenly Father, not a hair can fall from my head; yea, that all things must be subservient to my salvation, and therefore, by his Holy Spirit, He also assures me of eternal life, and makes me sincerely willing and ready, henceforth, to live unto him."

      "number": 4,
      "question": "What does the law of God require of us?",
      "answer": "Christ teaches us that briefly, Matt. 22:37-40, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength. This is the first and the great commandment; and the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\""

      "type": "qa",
      "number": 5,
      "question": "Canst thou keep all these things perfectly?",
      "answer": "In no wise; for I am prone by nature to hate God and my neighbour."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 6,
      "question": "Did God then create man so wicked and perverse?",
      "answer": "By no means; but God created man good, and after his own image, in true righteousness and holiness, that he might rightly know God his Creator, heartily love him and live with him in eternal happiness to glorify and praise him."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 7,
      "question": "Whence then proceeds this depravity of human nature?",
      "answer": "From the fall and disobedience of our first parents, Adam and Eve, in Paradise; hence our nature is become so corrupt, that we are all conceived and born in sin."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 8,
      "question": "Are we then so corrupt that we are wholly incapable of doing any good, and inclined to all wickedness?",

    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 9,
      "question": "Does not God then do injustice to man, by requiring from him in his law, that which he cannot perform?",
      "answer": "Not at all; for God made man capable of performing it; but man, by the instigation of the devil, and his own wilful disobedience, deprived himself and all his posterity of those divine gifts."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 10,
      "question": "Will God suffer such disobedience and rebellion to go unpunished?",
      "answer": "By no means; but is terribly displeased with our original as well as actual sins; and will punish them in his just judgment temporally and eternally, as he has declared, \"Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things, which are written in the book of the law, to do them.\""
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 11,
      "question": "Is not God then also merciful?",
      "answer": "God is indeed merciful, but also just; therefore his justice requires, that sin which is committed against the most high majesty of God, be also punished with extreme, that is, with everlasting punishment of body and soul."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 12,
      "question": "Since then, by the righteous judgment of God, we deserve temporal and eternal punishment, is there no way by which we may escape that punishment, and be again received into favour?",
      "answer": "God will have his justice satisfied: and therefore we must make this full satisfaction, either by ourselves, or by another."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 13,
      "question": "Can we ourselves then make this satisfaction?",
      "answer": "By no means; but on the contrary we daily increase our debt."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 14,
      "question": "Can there be found anywhere, one, who is a mere creature, able to satisfy for us?",
      "answer": "None; for, first, God will not punish any other creature for the sin which man has committed; and further, no mere creature can sustain the burden of God's eternal wrath against sin, so as to deliver others from it."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 15,
      "question": "What sort of a mediator and deliverer then must we seek for?",
      "answer": "For one who is very man, and perfectly righteous; and yet more powerful than all creatures; that is, one who is also very God."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 16,
      "question": "Why must he be very man, and also perfectly righteous?",
      "answer": "Because the justice of God requires that the same human nature which has sinned, should likewise make satisfaction for sin; and one, who is himself a sinner, cannot satisfy for others."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 17,
      "question": "Why must he in one person be also very God?",
      "answer": "That he might, by the power of his Godhead sustain in his human nature, the burden of God's wrath; and might obtain for, and restore to us, righteousness and life."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 18,

    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 19,
      "question": "Whence knowest thou this?",
      "answer": "From the holy gospel, which God himself first revealed in Paradise; and afterwards published by the patriarchs and prophets, and represented by the sacrifices and other ceremonies of the law; and lastly, has fulfilled it by his only begotten Son."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 20,
      "question": "Are all men then, as they perished in Adam, saved by Christ?",
      "answer": "No; only those who are ingrafted into him, and, receive all his benefits, by a true faith."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 21,
      "question": "What is true faith?",
      "answer": "True faith is not only a certain knowledge, whereby I hold for truth all that God has revealed to us in his word, but also an assured confidence, which the Holy Ghost works by the gospel in my heart; that not only to others, but to me also, remission of sin, everlasting righteousness and salvation, are freely given by God, merely of grace, only for the sake of Christ's merits."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 22,
      "question": "What is then necessary for a christian to believe?",
      "answer": "All things promised us in the gospel, which the articles of our catholic undoubted christian faith briefly teach us."

      "question": "What are these articles?",
      "answer": "I believe in God the Father, Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth: And in Jesus Christ, his only begotten Son, our Lord: Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary: Suffered under Pontius Pilate; was crucified, dead, and buried: He descended into hell: The third day he rose again from the dead: He ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty: From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead: I believe in the Holy Ghost: I believe a holy catholic church: the communion of saints: The forgiveness of sins: The resurrection of the body: And the life everlasting."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 24,
      "question": "How are these articles divided?",
      "answer": "Into three parts; the first is of God the Father, and our creation; the second of God the Son, and our redemption; the third of God the Holy Ghost, and our sanctification."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 25,
      "question": "Since there is but one only divine essence,[a] why speakest thou of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost?",
      "answer": "Because God has so revealed himself in his word, that these three distinct persons are the one only true and eternal God."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 26,
      "question": "What believest thou when thou sayest, \"I believe in God the Father, Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth\"?",
      "answer": "That the eternal Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (who of nothing made heaven and earth, with all that is in them; who likewise upholds and governs the same by his eternal counsel and providence) is for the sake of Christ his Son, my God and my Father; on whom I rely so entirely, that I have no doubt, but he will provide me with all things necessary for soul and body and further, that he will make whatever evils he sends upon me, in this valley of tears turn out to my advantage; for he is able to do it, being Almighty God, and willing, being a faithful Father."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 27,
      "question": "What dost thou mean by the providence of God?",
      "answer": "The almighty and everywhere present power of God; whereby, as it were by his hand, he upholds and governs heaven, earth, and all creatures; so that herbs and grass, rain and drought, fruitful and barren years, meat and drink, health and sickness, riches and poverty, yea, and all things come, not by chance, but by his fatherly hand."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 28,
      "question": "What advantage is it to us to know that God has created, and by his providence does still uphold all things?",
      "answer": "That we may be patient in adversity; thankful in prosperity; and that in all things, which may hereafter befall us, we place our firm trust in our faithful God and Father, that nothing shall separate us from his love; since all creatures are so in his hand, that without his will they cannot so much as move."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 29,
      "question": "Why is the Son of God called \"Jesus\", that is a Saviour?",
      "answer": "Because he saveth us, and delivereth us from our sins; and likewise, because we ought not to seek, neither can find salvation in any other."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 30,
      "question": "Do such then believe in Jesus the only Saviour, who seek their salvation and welfare of saints, of themselves, or anywhere else?",
      "answer": "They do not; for though they boast of him in words, yet in deeds they deny Jesus the only deliverer and Saviour; for one of these two things must be true, that either Jesus is not a complete Saviour; or that they, who by a true faith receive this Saviour, must find all things in him necessary to their salvation."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 31,
      "question": "Why is he called \"Christ\", that is anointed?",
      "answer": "Because he is ordained of God the Father, and anointed with the Holy Ghost, to be our chief Prophet and Teacher, who has fully revealed to us the secret counsel and will of God concerning our redemption; and to be our only High Priest, who by the one sacrifice of his body, has redeemed us, and makes continual intercession with the Father for us; and also to be our eternal King, who governs us by his word and Spirit, and who defends and preserves us in that salvation, he has purchased for us."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 32,
      "question": "But why art thou called a Christian?[a]",
      "answer": "Because I am a member of Christ by faith, and thus am partaker of his anointing; that so I may confess his name, and present myself a living sacrifice of thankfulness to him: and also that with a free and good conscience I may fight against sin and Satan in this life and afterwards I reign with him eternally, over all creatures."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 33,
      "question": "Why is Christ called the \"only begotten Son\" of God, since we are also the children of God?",
      "answer": "Because Christ alone is the eternal and natural Son of God; but we are children adopted of God, by grace, for his sake."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 34,
      "question": "Wherefore callest thou him \"our Lord\"?",
      "answer": "Because he hath redeemed us, both soul and body, from all our sins, not with silver or gold, but with his precious blood, and has delivered us from all the power of the devil; and thus has made us his own property."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 35,
      "question": ". What is the meaning of these words \"He was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the virgin Mary\"?",
      "answer": "That God's eternal Son, who is, and continues true and eternal God, took upon him the very nature of man, of the flesh and blood of the virgin Mary, by the operation of the Holy Ghost; that he might also be the true seed of David, like unto his brethren in all things, sin excepted."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 36,
      "question": "What profit dost thou receive by Christ's holy conception and nativity?",
      "answer": "That he is our Mediator; and with His innocence and perfect holiness, covers in the sight of God, my sins, wherein I was conceived and brought forth."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 37,
      "question": "What dost thou understand by the words, \"He suffered\"?",
      "answer": "That he, all the time that he lived on earth, but especially at the end of his life, sustained in body and soul, the wrath of God against the sins of all mankind: that so by his passion, as the only propitiatory sacrifice, he might redeem our body and soul from everlasting damnation, and obtain for us the favour of God, righteousness and eternal life."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 38,
      "question": "Why did he suffer \"under Pontius Pilate, as judge\"?",
      "answer": "That he, being innocent, and yet condemned by a temporal judge, might thereby free us from the severe judgement of God to which we were exposed."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 39,
      "question": "Is there anything more in his being \"crucified\", than if he had died some other death?",
      "answer": "Yes there is; for thereby I am assured, that he took on him the curse which lay upon me; for the death of the cross was accursed of God."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 40,
      "question": "Why was it necessary for Christ to humble himself even \"unto death\"?",
      "answer": "Because with respect to the justice and truth of God, satisfaction for our sins could be made no otherwise, than by the death of the Son of God."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 41,
      "question": "Why was he also \"buried\"?",
      "answer": "Thereby to prove that he was really dead."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 42,
      "question": "Since then Christ died for us, why must we also die?",
      "answer": "Our death is not a satisfaction for our sins, but only an abolishing of sin, and a passage into eternal life."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 43,
      "question": "What further benefit do we receive from the sacrifice and death of Christ on the cross?",
      "answer": "That by virtue thereof, our old man is crucified, dead and buried with him; that so the corrupt inclinations of the flesh may no more reign in us; but that we may offer ourselves unto him a sacrifice of thanksgiving."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 44,
      "question": "Why is there added, \"he descended into hell\"?",
      "answer": "That in my greatest temptations, I may be assured, and wholly comfort myself in this, that my Lord Jesus Christ, by his inexpressible anguish, pains, terrors, and hellish agonies, in which he was plunged during all his sufferings, but especially on the cross, has delivered me from the anguish and torments of hell."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 45,
      "question": "What does the \"resurrection\" of Christ profit us?",
      "answer": "First, by his resurrection he has overcome death, that he might make us partakers of that righteousness which he had purchased for us by his death; secondly, we are also by his power raised up to a new life; and lastly, the resurrection of Christ is a sure pledge of our blessed resurrection."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 46,
      "question": "How dost thou understand these words, \"he ascended into heaven\"?",
      "answer": "That Christ, in sight of his disciples, was taken up from earth into heaven; and that he continues there for our interest, until he comes again to judge the quick and the dead."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 47,
      "question": "Is not Christ then with us even to the end of the world, as he has promised?[a]",
      "answer": "Christ is very man and very God; with respect to his human nature, he is no more on earth; but with respect to his Godhead, majesty, grace and spirit, he is at no time absent from us."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 48,
      "question": "But if his human nature is not present, wherever his Godhead is, are not then these two natures in Christ separated from one another?",
      "answer": "Not as all, for since the Godhead is illimitable and omnipresent, it must necessarily follow that the same is beyond the limits of the human nature he assumed, and yet is nevertheless in this human nature, and remains personally united to it."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 49,
      "question": "Of what advantage to us is Christ's ascension into heaven?",
      "answer": "First, that he is our advocate in the presence of his Father in heaven; secondly, that we have our flesh in heaven as a sure pledge that he, as the head, will also take up to himself, us, his members; thirdly, that he sends us his Spirit as an earnest, by whose power we \"seek the things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God, and not things on earth.\""
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 50,
      "question": "Why is it added, \"and sitteth at the right hand of God\"?",
      "answer": "Because Christ is ascended into heaven for this end, that he might appear as head of his church, by whom the Father governs all things."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 51,
      "question": "What profit is this glory of Christ, our head, unto us?",
      "answer": "First, that by his Holy Spirit he pours out heavenly graces upon us his members; and then that by his power he defends and preserves us against all enemies."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 52,
      "question": "What comfort is it to thee that \"Christ shall come again to judge the quick and the dead\"?",
      "answer": "That in all my sorrows and persecutions, with uplifted head I look for the very same person, who before offered himself for my sake, to the tribunal of God, and has removed all curse from me, to come as judge from heaven: who shall cast all his and my enemies into everlasting condemnation, but shall translate me with all his chosen ones to himself, into heavenly joys and glory."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 53,
      "question": "What dost thou believe concerning the Holy Ghost?",
      "answer": "First, that he is true and coeternal God with the Father and the Son; secondly, that he is also given me, to make me by a true faith, partaker of Christ and all his benefits, that he may comfort me and abide with me for ever."

      "type": "qa",
      "number": 54,
      "question": "What believest thou concerning the \"holy catholic church\" of Christ?",
      "answer": "That the Son of God from the beginning to the end of the world, gathers, defends, and preserves to himself by his Spirit and word, out of the whole human race, a church chosen to everlasting life, agreeing in true faith; and that I am and forever shall remain, a living member thereof."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 55,
      "question": "What do you understand by \"the communion of saints\"?",
      "answer": "First, that all and every one, who believes, being members of Christ, are in common, partakers of him, and of all his riches and gifts; secondly, that every one must know it to be his duty, readily and cheerfully to employ his gifts, for the advantage and salvation of other members."
    },

      "type": "qa",
      "number": 56,
      "question": "What believest thou concerning \"the forgiveness of sins\"?",
      "answer": "That God, for the sake of Christ's satisfaction, will no more remember my sins, neither my corrupt nature, against which I have to struggle all my life long; but will graciously impute to me the righteousness of Christ, that I may never be condemned before the tribunal of God."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 57,
      "question": "What comfort does the \"resurrection of the body\" afford thee?",
      "answer": "That not only my soul after this life shall be immediately taken up to Christ its head; but also, that this my body, being raised by the power of Christ, shall be reunited with my soul, and made like unto the glorious body of Christ."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 58,
      "question": "What comfort takest thou from the article of \"life everlasting\"?",
      "answer": "That since I now feel in my heart the beginning of eternal joy, after this life, I shall inherit perfect salvation, which \"eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither has it entered into the heart of man\" to conceive, and that to praise God therein for ever."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 59,
      "question": "But what does it profit thee now that thou believest all this?",
      "answer": "That I am righteous in Christ, before God, and an heir of eternal life."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 60,
      "question": "How are thou righteous before God?",
      "answer": "Only by a true faith in Jesus Christ; so that, though my conscience accuse me, that I have grossly transgressed all the commandments of God, and kept none of them, and am still inclined to all evil; notwithstanding, God, without any merit of mine, but only of mere grace, grants and imputes to me, the perfect satisfaction, righteousness and holiness of Christ; even so, as if I never had had, nor committed any sin: yea, as if I had fully accomplished all that obedience which Christ has accomplished for me; inasmuch as I embrace such benefit with a believing heart."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 61,
      "question": "Why sayest thou, that thou art righteous by faith only?",
      "answer": "Not that I am acceptable to God, on account of the worthiness of my faith; but because only the satisfaction, righteousness, and holiness of Christ, is my righteousness before God; and that I cannot receive and apply the same to myself any other way than by faith only."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 62,
      "question": "But why cannot our good works be the whole, or part of our righteousness before God?",
      "answer": "Because, that the righteousness, which can be approved of before the tribunal of God, must be absolutely perfect, and in all respects conformable to the divine law; and also, that our best works in this life are all imperfect and defiled with sin."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 63,
      "question": "What! do not our good works merit, which yet God will reward in this and in a future life?",
      "answer": "This reward is not of merit, but of grace."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 64,
      "question": "But does not this doctrine make men careless and profane?",
      "answer": "By no means: for it is impossible that those, who are implanted into Christ by a true faith, should not bring forth fruits of thankfulness."

      "answer": "In the institution of the supper, which is thus expressed: \"The Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and: said: eat, this is my body, which is broken for you; this do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying: this cup is the new testament in my blood; this do ye, as often as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For, as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till he come.\" 1 Cor.11:23-26. This promise is repeated by the holy apostle Paul, where he says \"The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.\" 1 Cor.10:16,17."

      "answer": "Christ speaks thus, not without great reason, namely, not only thereby to teach us, that as bread and wine support this temporal life, so his crucified body and shed blood are the true meat and drink, whereby our souls are fed to eternal life; but more especially by these visible signs and pledges to assure us, that we are as really partakers of his true body and blood by the operation of the Holy Ghost as we receive by the mouths of our bodies these holy signs in remembrance of him; and that all his sufferings and obedience are as certainly ours, as if we had in our own persons suffered and made satisfaction for our sins to God."

But the mass teaches, that the living and dead have not the pardon of sins through the sufferings of Christ, unless Christ is also daily offered for them by the priests; and further, that Christ is bodily under the form of bread and wine, and therefore is to be worshipped in them; so that the mass, at bottom, is nothing else than a denial of the one sacrifice and sufferings of Jesus Christ, and an accursed idolatry."

      "question": "Why has Christ commanded us to address God thus: \"Our Father\"?",
      "answer": "That immediately, in the very beginning of our prayer, he might excite in us a childlike reverence for, and confidence in God, which are the foundation of our prayer: namely, that God is become our Father in Christ, and will much less deny us what we ask of him in true faith, than our parents will refuse us earthly things."

      "type": "qa",
      "number": 121,
      "question": "Why is it here added, \"Which art in heaven\"?",
      "answer": "Lest we should form any earthly conceptions of God's heavenly majesty, and that we may expect from his almighty power all things necessary for soul and body."

      "type": "qa",
      "number": 122,
      "question": "Which is the first petition?",
      "answer": "\"Hallowed be thy name\"; that is, grant us, first, rightly to know thee, and to sanctify, glorify and praise thee, in all thy works, in which thy power, wisdom, goodness, justice, mercy and truth, are clearly displayed; and further also, that we may so order and direct our whole lives, our thoughts, words and actions, that thy name may never be blasphemed, but rather honoured and praised on our account."

      "type": "qa",
      "number": 123,
      "question": "Which is the second petition?",
      "answer": "\"Thy kingdom come\"; that is, rule us so by thy word and Spirit, that we may submit ourselves more and more to thee; preserve and increase thy church; destroy the works of the devil, and all violence which would exalt itself against thee; and also all wicked counsels devised against thy holy word; till the full perfection of thy kingdom take place, wherein thou shalt be all in all."

      "number": 124,
      "question": "Which is the third petition?",
      "answer": "\"Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven\"; that is, grant that we and all men may renounce our own will, and without murmuring obey thy will, which is only good; that every one may attend to, and perform the duties of his station and calling, as willingly and faithfully as the angels do in heaven."

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 125,
      "question": "Which is the fourth petition?",
      "answer": "\"Give us this day our daily bread\"; that is, be pleased to provide us with all things necessary for the body, that we may thereby acknowledge thee to be the only fountain of all good, and that neither our care nor industry, nor even thy gifts, can profit us without thy blessing; and therefore that we may withdraw our trust from all creatures, and place it alone in thee."

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 126,
      "question": "Which is the fifth petition?",
      "answer": "\"And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors\"; that is, be pleased for the sake of Christ's blood, not to impute to us poor sinners, our transgressions, nor that depravity, which always cleaves to us; even as we feel this evidence of thy grace in us, that it is our firm resolution from the heart to forgive our neighbour."

      "type": "qa",
      "number": 127,
      "question": "Which is the sixth petition?",
      "answer": "\"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil\"; that is, since we are so weak in ourselves, that we cannot stand a moment; and besides this, since our mortal enemies, the devil, the world, and our own flesh, cease not to assault us, do thou therefore preserve and strengthen us by the power of thy Holy Spirit, that we may not be overcome in this spiritual warfare, but constantly and strenuously may resist our foes, till at last we obtain a complete victory."

    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 128,
      "question": "How dost thou conclude thy prayer?",
      "answer": "\"For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever\"; that is, all these we ask of thee, because thou, being our King and almighty, art willing and able to give us all good; and all this we pray for, that thereby not we, but thy holy name, may be glorified for ever."
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "number": 129,
      "question": "What does the word \"Amen\" signify?",
      "answer": "\"Amen\" signifies, it shall truly and certainly be: for my prayer is more assuredly heard of God, than I feel in my heart that I desire these things of him."
