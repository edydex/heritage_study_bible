      "text": "Welcome to Gavin Ortlund's commentary on the Book of Revelation from his video 'Explaining Every Chapter of Revelation'.\n\nThe Book of Revelation is one of the most fascinating and challenging books of the Bible. It was written by the apostle John while he was exiled on the island of Patmos. The book contains apocalyptic visions that reveal God's ultimate plan for humanity and creation.\n\nTo get the full commentary, please ensure the DOCX file is in the project root and run 'npm run parse-docx'."

This shows both the divine origin and the intended audience of this prophecy.\n\nVerse 3 contains the first of seven beatitudes in Revelation: 'Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy.' This emphasizes that Revelation was meant to be read aloud in churches and taken seriously by believers."

Verse 7 contains one of the key themes of Revelation: Christ's visible return that all will witness."

The twelve gates named for Israel's tribes and twelve foundations named for the apostles show continuity between old and new covenants.\n\nThere is no temple because God and the Lamb are its temple. No sun or moon because God's glory illuminates it. The gates never close because there is no threat. This is the ultimate fulfillment of God dwelling with His people."

The curse is removed; God's servants will see His face and reign forever.\n\nThe book ends with urgency: 'I am coming quickly.' The Spirit and the Bride say 'Come!' - both an invitation to unbelievers and a prayer for Christ's return.\n\nJohn's response - 'Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!' - should be the prayer of every believer. The book that began with blessing ends with grace."
